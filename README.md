## Getting Started

```sbt
libraryDependencies += "net.exoego" %%% "aws-sdk-scalajs-facade" % "0.19.0"
```

## Origin 

Auto-generated from [aws-sdk-scalajs-facade-generator](https://github.com/exoego/aws-sdk-scalajs-facade-generator).

This project started as a fork of awesome [balshor/aws-sdk-scalajs-facade](https://github.com/balshor/aws-sdk-scalajs-facade).

Intention of fork is to

* Re-design based on my team's preference since my projects are blessed with this facade.
* Continue updating with eco-system (Scala.JS and aws-sdk) timely.
* Make it more type-safe and easier to use.
* Add some convenient bridges between Node.js and Scala.js.
